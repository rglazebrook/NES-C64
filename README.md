The NES-C64 is a non-destructive drop-in replacement PCB to convert an original NES-004 controller to a Commodore 64 controller. Once the board is put together, you simply open the original NES controller, remove the PCB and cable, and then add the new board and cable. If you ever want to convert the controller back to NES use, it's as simple as reversing the process.
